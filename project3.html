        <h2 class="mb-4" style="color: #6c63ff;">Projects Overview</h2>
        <p>This page highlights my expertise in internet programming, ranging from DNS configuration and email systems to web development, API integration, and database management. Below are key concepts and technologies I've worked on, along with practical applications and screenshots.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Domain Name System (DNS)</h3>
        <p>DNS plays a critical role in internet communication. I worked with various DNS records like MX, PTR, A, and NS, and advanced features like DNSSEC for security. I also explored how DNS is used in load balancing and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to improve content distribution.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Email Communication Systems</h3>
        <p>In this area, I configured email servers and studied protocols like SMTP, IMAP, and HTTP for sending and receiving emails. I also integrated email with DNS using MX, PTR, and TXT records to ensure secure email communication. I explored security measures such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to prevent email spoofing and improve email security.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Web API Technologies</h3>
        <p>I have extensive experience working with JSON and REST APIs, developing web services that interact with third-party systems. APIs provide the backbone for many web applications, allowing seamless communication between services.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Identity and Access Management (IAM) Systems</h3>
        <p>I configured IAM systems using LDAP for directory services and OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication. These systems are essential for managing user identity, access control, and enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) across applications.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Integrating Communication Systems</h3>
        <p>I integrated SMS communication systems with web applications, using SMS for network alerts, IoT system control, and mobile payments. This integration enabled real-time communication and action triggers using text messages for processes like firewall management and mobile checkout.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Cookies and Session Management</h3>
        <p>Session management is critical for secure and persistent user sessions in web applications. I implemented cookies for storing user data on the client side and managed sessions on the server to ensure a seamless experience for users.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">HTTP Headers and Connections</h3>
        <p>Understanding HTTP headers like the CONNECTION attribute helped me optimize the performance of web servers and API clients. Controlling connection settings in HTTP allows for better management of server resources and faster response times.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Web Proxy and Content Delivery Networks (CDN)</h3>
        <p>I utilized web proxies and CDNs to improve the efficiency of web content delivery, reduce latency, and handle large traffic loads by distributing content closer to the end-users. CDNs are crucial for optimizing web performance, especially in globally distributed applications.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">PHP and MySQL for Web Development</h3>
        <p>I developed web applications using PHP and MySQL, including user authentication, database integration, and URL redirection services. These technologies form the foundation for many dynamic web applications, allowing efficient data storage and retrieval.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">JavaScript and CSS for Dynamic Web Pages</h3>
        <p>I used JavaScript for handling dynamic form input and enabling interactive web elements. Alongside this, I applied CSS to style web pages, ensuring visually appealing layouts and responsive designs that adapt to different devices.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Database Management Systems (DBMS)</h3>
        <p>In database management, I worked with relational databases to apply integrity rules and manage relationships between tables using foreign keys and candidate keys. I also implemented database security using encryption and access control methods.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Transaction Management and Security</h3>
        <p>Ensuring the integrity of database transactions is critical. I applied ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure reliable database transactions. I also used shared and exclusive locks to control concurrent access and prevent data corruption.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">SQL Scripting and Querying</h3>
        <p>I have written complex SQL queries for data selection, filtering, and updating records in relational databases. I also focused on normalization techniques to eliminate anomalies in data storage and ensure data integrity across the system.</p>
